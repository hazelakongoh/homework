## Recommendation
* If i could advise Valon, i will recommend they add life insurance to the already existing home insurance they are offering.
* This offering is because usually the home owner's life span can be directly related to the span of paying mortgage, so if the customer unfortunately dies, a portion of the benefit can cover the remaining mortgage.
